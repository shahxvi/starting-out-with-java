Data may be saved in a file.
There are three steps that are taken when a file is used by a program:
1. The file must be *opened*. When the file is opened, a connection is created between the file and the program
2. Data is then written to the file or read from the file
3. When the program is finished using the file, the file must be *closed*.

There's two types of files:
1. Text
2. Binary

JavaAPI: `import java.io.*;`
